Summary:
  A web app that allows users to interact with well known search engines anonymously, which maintains their privacy and prevents search engines from collecting their data.


Using Goolge Search:
Make a text file called "GoogleApiKey.txt" Make sure it is at the correct directory.(root directory where the pom.xml and README.md are)
Go to https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview and under API key click on Get A Key.
Put the API key into the first line of the text file.
Then put
017576662512468239146:omuauf_lfve
into the second line of the text file. This is the search engine ID.
Make sure that the order is corect, the api key in the first line, search engine ID in the second.
Google search will now work after you run the webapp.
