Summary:
  A web app that allows users to interact with well known search engines anonymously, which maintains their privacy and prevents search engines from collecting their data.

I got the subscription key I need to use the API using this tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account
